# cinebench_scores
Additional single and multi core score files for various CPUs that can be included in Cinebench r15, r20, r23 and Cinebench 2024, so they display directly within the program.


## How to:
Download the correct zip file for your Cinebench installation and extract the files directly into the `cb_ranking` directory of your Cinebench installation. Do not create a sub folder while extracting.

Example: Download `scores_cb_r23.zip` and extract it to `E:\_Overclock\Cinebench_r23\cb_ranking\`
